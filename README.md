# 🌿 Smart Sustainability Analytics: Data-Driven Insights for a Greener Future

A 45-day end-to-end Data Science project combining **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning** — focused on identifying patterns in sustainability and environmental performance using freely available open datasets.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Collect and analyze **public sustainability datasets** (energy, emissions, or water usage).
- Identify **key patterns and correlations** using statistical and visualization techniques.
- Build **machine learning models** to predict or classify sustainability performance.
- Showcase an **end-to-end Data Science workflow** — from data collection to model interpretation.
